## Roadmap
This test was made in the period of 7 days, where it had to be created a website to show Star Wars movies and characters. 

The platform, in the characters part, has a two filters: one filtering genders and the other one filtering eye colors. Also it has to have a detail of all the characters. I used swapi API to show the films and characters. 

When you first enter the web you can see the landing where there's a display of all the films.

If you click on any movie you can see the details of every character that movie has. Where you can find: name, gender and eye color.

The technologies used for this project where:

- Javascript.
- React.
- Redux Toolkit to manage the information of the API and requests for such.
- TailwindCSS for the design.
- And Axios for handling the asynchronous parts of the project.



## Usage

You can see the website on the [deploy](https://gualda-challenge.vercel.app/), or you can run it in your PC.

The first thing you have to do is clone the repository, open powershell or git bash and copy it. Once you open it in Visual studio code or your editor of preference, you open the terminal and use the command `npm install` or `npm i` so the modules can install and everything works perfectly. Then you run the command `npm start` to load the project and voilÃ¡! you, now, have the project running in your computer.

Hope you have fun checking it out.
Have a great day! ðŸ‘‹
